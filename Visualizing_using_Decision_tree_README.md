Using Scikit-learn to Implement a Simple Decision Tree Classifier

The iris samples in question fall into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. At first glance, the three species can look remarkably like each other, and this is especially the case for the latter two. However, thanks to the careful measurements taken and presented by Anderson and Fisher, an individual sample may be classified with a high degree of accuracy via machine learning models if the relevant measurements are taken.

Decision tree models are the simplest form of tree-based models, and are arguably the simplest form of supervised multivariate classification models. A series of logical tests (generally in the form of boolean comparisons) are applied to the sample entries and their resulting subsets in turn to arrive at a final decision. It is very easy to visualize the decision process in a simple flowchart to trace the rational of every assignment made by a decision tree model, making it among the most interpretable of models.
